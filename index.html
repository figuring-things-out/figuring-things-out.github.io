            <p class="description">For a long time I have wanted to make educational animations. I finally began this blog and associated social media accounts after discovering Processing.<br> <br>My hope is that I can use aesthetically pleasing visualizations and animations to inspire others to learn, create, admire and figure things out.

            <img class="cover" src="./images/montecarlopi_tiny.png">
            <p class="description">Monte Carlo simulations use random variables and/or sampling to determine numerical results. This is an example of a Monte Carlo simulation that estimates the value of pi by
                simply generating random (X,Y) points between -1 and 1. The estimate can then be calculated using the number of points inside the unit circle and the total number of points that were generated.

            <p class="description">In wireless communication systems, information which is typically a series of 1’s and 0’s, 
                is modulated onto some carrier signal. Modulation simply means varying some property of the carrier signal to 
                imprint this information. On off keying is one of the simplest modulation types. It varies the amplitude, 
                either completely on or off.</p>

            <p class="description">Generative art is an exciting field that uses algorithms, mathematics, and autonomous systems to create works of art. 

                This is just one example I have come up with to introduce the topic. This algorithm
                recreates an image with somewhat random white lines based on the brightness of each pixel in the original picture.

            <p class="description">Did you know, in a group of only 23 random people, there’s a 50% chance that two of them have the same birthday? <br>
                This is called the birthday paradox and is based on the pigeonhole principle found in probability and statistics. 
                This animation performs 4 rounds of the birthday paradox experiment by generating random birthdays and looking for a match. </p>

            <img class="cover" src="./images/SignalTypes_tiny.png">
            <p class="description">In digital signal processing it is important to understand the difference between analog and digital signals, as well as continuous and discrete signals. 

                Analog signals can be of any Y value, and digital signals can only be at certain “levels” of Y values. 
                
                Discrete signals only have values at certain time steps, and continuous signals have values across all time. </p>

            <img class="cover" src="./images/Counting_tiny.png">
            <p class="description">The most common way to count uses 10 symbols, which is also called the decimal system. 
                But computers and many other technology use different systems - such as binary, octal, and hexadecimal. What 
                really matters and makes these different is the number of symbols. The concept of counting does not change, 
                only the number of symbols used. </p>

            <img class="cover" src="./images/Orbits_tiny.png">
            <p class="description">Depending on the purpose, satellites orbit the earth is different ways. A satellite may fly lower in altitude which means at higher speeds, or at higher 
                altitudes resulting in lower speeds. The geosynchronous (GEO) orbit is a unique orbit that actually matches the 
                earth’s rotation. GEO satellites appear to not move and provide constant coverage over one point 
                on the earth.</p>

            <img class="cover" src="./images/KeypadCircuit_tiny.png">
            <p class="description">Have you ever wondered how a calculator or garage door keypad works? 
                It probably uses a circuit similar to this one. There is a voltage applied to each row at different times, 
                and when a button is pressed it connects the circuit, which can be detected at each column. 
                The pressed button is determined using the unique combination of row and column. </p>

            <img class="cover" src="./images/AMFM_tiny.png">
            <p class="description">Did you know the “AM” in AM Radio stands for amplitude modulation and the “FM” in FM Radio stands for frequency modulation? 
                AM takes a message signal and imprints that message on a carrier signal by changing the amplitude. FM does the same thing by changes the frequency of the carrier. </p>
